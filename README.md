# Our wedding website

Hello there ğŸ‘‹
This is website made for my wedding with my gorgeous girlfriend.

We need to get feedback from our guests about what they want to eat and whether they want to spend the night. So I decided to create this hand in hand with blazing [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for frontend, [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) for backend and [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/) for deployment.
